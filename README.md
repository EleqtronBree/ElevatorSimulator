# ElevatorSimulator
Project for Envia designed on Roblox Studio (Oct 2018)

The Elevator Simulator was a game where players join the elevator as it takes them to different rooms or worlds.
The game was active until January 2019, when the game was bought by a client and has been updated to suit their needs. 
This depository contains the old core scripts of the game and should be used as reference only.
